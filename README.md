Solar Panel Simulation & Control Panel

This project is an interactive solar panel simulation built with Python, Tkinter, and OpenGL (PyOpenGL).
It visualizes solar panel behavior, simulating sunlight direction, energy efficiency, and dynamic battery charging.
The Tkinter interface provides a control panel for adjusting the panel’s tilt and azimuth angles, monitoring real-time power output, and controlling battery charging.

Features
Graphical User Interface (Tkinter)

Intuitive control panel for managing the solar panel simulation.

Real-time display of:

Tilt and azimuth angles

Sun altitude and azimuth

Efficiency (%)

Power input/output

Instant power generation

3D Simulation (OpenGL)

Realistic visualization of:

The sun’s position and movement

Solar panel orientation

House model, grass field, and sky with clouds

Dynamic lighting and reflections

Adjustable camera angle (via mouse drag and scroll).

Battery Simulation

Visual 3D battery bank that dynamically charges or discharges.

Optional battery charging toggle in the control panel.

⚙️ Installation
Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Then install the required libraries:

pip install numpy PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate tkinter


(Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.)

Usage

Run the Control Panel:

python main.py


Click “Start Simulation” to launch the OpenGL visualization window.

Adjust parameters:

Tilt Angle (°) – changes how the panel faces the sun vertically.

Azimuth (°) – rotates the panel horizontally.

Enable Battery Charging – toggles battery charging simulation.

Click “Show Power Output” to display real-time statistics.

Controls (Simulation Window)
Action	Control

How It Works

The simulation calculates solar efficiency using the dot product between the sun direction vector and the panel’s normal vector.

The GUI sends tilt/azimuth updates to the simulation dynamically.

Battery charge updates gradually based on current power output and consumption rate.
